# Hey

This is my submission on https://internshala.com/internship/detail/backend-development-work-from-home-job-internship-at-ux-***** .

I created this in plain CSS and Vanilla JS.
The design is made to look exactly as per `design1` & `design2` files.

The app also handles the requests directly through product links!

Thanks for the task.
